## How to use example

* Firstly, check my demo video: https://youtube.com/shorts/Uvc1HDPJlrw?feature=share


### Hardware Required

* A development board with any Espressif SoC (e.g., ESP32-DevKitC, ESP-WROVER-KIT, etc.)
* A USB cable for Power supply and programming

### Software Required

* I am using Espressif-IDE, ESP32 environment built-in IDE, the newest release.
* Using Python 13 

### Build and Flash

* If you use Espressif-IDE, just clone this project from my github, then, it will be simply to run

## Example Output

As you run the example, you will see the following log:
